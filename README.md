# Blood-Bank-Management-System
This is a blood bank donation form I created for a group project in Web Applications course. This has form that takes input then stores them in the database. There's HTML, PHP and mySQL thrown in. I've used Xampp, PHPmyAdmin and Visual Studio. I did use Youtube to find a little of SQL code.
